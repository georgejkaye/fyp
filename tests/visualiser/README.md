# Visualiser unit tests

The images in this folder are some of the terms with hand-drawn maps that compared with the maps drawn by the visualiser. Files suffixed with `h` are the hand-drawn maps, and files suffixed with `v` show the corresponding output of the visualiser.

Where used, the variables `a` and `b` represent free variables, abstracted in that order.
