# Normalisation graph unit tests

The images in this folder are some of the hand-drawn normalisation graphs that were compared with the graphs drawn by the visualiser. Files suffixed with `h` are the hand-drawn graphs, and files suffixed with `v` show the corresponding output of the visualiser.

In the hand-drawn graphs, edges are numbered to represent which redex they refer to, using the outermost leftmost traversal convention detailed in the report.
