* Make the edges go the right way round on graphs (order matters!):
    * lambda (anti-clockwise)
        * abstraction from bottom (A -> B)
        * right is variable A
        * left is body B
    * application ( clockwise)
        * function top: A -> B
        * argument u right A
        * t(u) left B
    * I think I've done this!
* ~~Actually do proposal~~
* ~~Graph labels are pretty dodgy, fix these~~
