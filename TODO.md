* ~~Make the edges go the right way round on graphs (order matters!)~~:
    * ~~lambda (anti-clockwise)~~
        * ~~abstraction from bottom (A -> B)~~
        * ~~right is variable A~~
        * ~~left is body B~~
    * ~~application (clockwise)~~
        * ~~function top: A -> B~~
        * ~~argument u right A~~
        * ~~t(u) left B~~
    * ~~I think I've done this!~~
* ~~Actually do proposal~~
* ~~Graph labels are pretty dodgy, fix these~~
* ~~Make Haskell functions for generating and enumerating terms of various types~~
* ~~Convert these Haskell functions into Javascript~~
* ~~Generate 'galleries' of terms from various fragments~~
* ~~Fix map drawing bug involving free variables with the same name as bound variables (e.g. (\x.x) x)~~
* ~~Highlighting issues when redex exists inside alias~~
* ~~Work on pair functions~~
* ~~Crazy reset bug reset visualiser to random term, maybe not setting current term somewhere?~~
* ~~Make sure terms with infinite reduction loops are handled gracefully~~
* ~~Free variables aren't being labelled properly for some reason~~
* ~~Way of automatically parsing in aliases?~~
* ~~Identify what makes the long time for graphs~~
* ~~Make normalisation graphs less laggy somehow~~
* ~~Work on making maps easier to read for big boys~~
