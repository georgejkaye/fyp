* ~~Make the edges go the right way round on graphs (order matters!)~~:
    * ~~lambda (anti-clockwise)~~
        * ~~abstraction from bottom (A -> B)~~
        * ~~right is variable A~~
        * ~~left is body B~~
    * ~~application (clockwise)~~
        * ~~function top: A -> B~~
        * ~~argument u right A~~
        * ~~t(u) left B~~
    * ~~I think I've done this!~~
* ~~Actually do proposal~~
* ~~Graph labels are pretty dodgy, fix these~~
* ~~Make Haskell functions for generating and enumerating terms of various types~~
* Convert these Haskell functions into Javascript
* Generate 'galleries' of terms from various fragments
